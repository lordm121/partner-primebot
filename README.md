# Discord Bot Dashboard

Web dashboard for [SFSA](https://github.com/charfweh/superfastserverassistant)
### About
Control your server with the Bot Dashboard, make em multiple roles, channels, voice channels, categories and you tell me. Made for Server admins and owner!
#### Note:
**You can use this Project to make your own dashboard, I'd love to see what you can make out of it**

This project serves as a starter pack for **Bot+Dashboard**, It'll not be continued for further production, use it for your own project and make something! you'll learn a lot, I'm sure about that.

I made it for the beginners who got no idea how to start and wondering how in the good world does it work and my answer to that is just get started you'll get there slowly but surely, have fun coding~

Please refer to SFSA [Readme](https://github.com/charfweh/superfastserverassistant#readme) for more info.
